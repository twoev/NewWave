  * Rivet example now compiles, though not useful yet
  * Moved GSL_enabled.cc to GSLEngine.cc - if GSL not present, simply can't make one, no need for GSL_disabled.cc

  * Add header file for NewWave/GSLEngine.hh, otherwise we have no way of instantiating one!
  * Put all relevant headers in a convenient NewWave.hh
  * Started example Rivet routine in examples/NewWave-Rivet.cc - it doesn't compile yet, but you should get the idea of the intended use
