  * Started HepMC example
  * HepMC template specialisations work now

2014-06-16  James Monk  <jmonk@cern.ch>
  * Check that particle is covered by PixelDefinition now added
  * Can construct WaveletEvent directly from list of particles
  * Filter method on WaveletEvent - allow filtering by user defined function

2014-06-15  James Monk  <jmonk@cern.ch>
  * More fixes - denoise works now in Rivet example
  * Todo: need check on particle rapidity in RasterisedEvent because Rivet particles are selected by *pseudo* rapidity.

2014-06-13  James Monk  <jmonk@cern.ch>
  * Templated WaveletEvent so it can return particles
  * Divide methods for PixelArray in Utils.hh

2014-06-12  James Monk  <jmonk@cern.ch>
  * Rivet example now compiles, though not useful yet
  * Moved GSL_enabled.cc to GSLEngine.cc - if GSL not present, simply can't make one, no need for GSL_disabled.cc

2014-06-10  James Monk  <jmonk@cern.ch>
  * Add header file for NewWave/GSLEngine.hh, otherwise we have no way of instantiating one!
  * Put all relevant headers in a convenient NewWave.hh
  * Started example Rivet routine in examples/NewWave-Rivet.cc - it doesn't compile yet, but you should get the idea of the intended use
