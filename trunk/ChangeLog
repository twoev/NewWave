  *  replace Momentum::scale with Momentum::update - this allows the decision
     on what to do with rejected particles to be user-defined.
     e.g. particles can be modified in place, zeroed instead of rejected

2014-11-24  James Monk  <jmonk@cern.ch>
  *  Remove Momentum.hh again :/
  *  Add Momentum<T> class to MomentumHelpers.hh
  *  Momentumm functions used now defineable in WaveletEvent via templated
   class, which defaults to Momentum<T>.  New definitions can be used to
   provide e.g. different pT or rapidity functions.

  * Removed RasterisedEvent from use (still present in svn)
    Slight speed up as a result of not copying array
  * Added Momentum.hh - not used yet, but possible flexibility in
    defining momentum functions for retrieving (pseudo) rapidity or eT/pT

2014-09-29  James Monk  <jmonk@cern.ch>
  *  Add "unique" key for wavelet coefficients (helps to compare coeffs)
  *  GSLEngine fills in that key

2014-08-21  James Monk  <jmonk@cern.ch>
  * Add WaveletEvent::setPileUpThreshold(double), which gives a 
    threshold for discarding pile up particles.  Any particle that,
    after filtering, has pT < thresh * original pT is discarded

  * Add nLevels() to PixelDefinition

2014-08-01  James Monk  <jmonk@cern.ch>
  * Add MomentumHelpers.hh - templated helper funcs to extract momentum quantities from particles
  * Use momentum helper funcs inside WaveletEvent and RasterisedEvent for more general particle case

2014-07-28  James Monk  <jmonk@cern.ch>
  * Initialise particles to input particles for WaveletEvent

2014-06-18  James Monk <jmonk@cern.ch>
  * Started HepMC example
  * HepMC template specialisations work now

2014-06-16  James Monk  <jmonk@cern.ch>
  * Check that particle is covered by PixelDefinition now added
  * Can construct WaveletEvent directly from list of particles
  * Filter method on WaveletEvent - allow filtering by user defined function

2014-06-15  James Monk  <jmonk@cern.ch>
  * More fixes - denoise works now in Rivet example
  * Todo: need check on particle rapidity in RasterisedEvent because Rivet particles are selected by *pseudo* rapidity.

2014-06-13  James Monk  <jmonk@cern.ch>
  * Templated WaveletEvent so it can return particles
  * Divide methods for PixelArray in Utils.hh

2014-06-12  James Monk  <jmonk@cern.ch>
  * Rivet example now compiles, though not useful yet
  * Moved GSL_enabled.cc to GSLEngine.cc - if GSL not present, simply can't make one, no need for GSL_disabled.cc

2014-06-10  James Monk  <jmonk@cern.ch>
  * Add header file for NewWave/GSLEngine.hh, otherwise we have no way of instantiating one!
  * Put all relevant headers in a convenient NewWave.hh
  * Started example Rivet routine in examples/NewWave-Rivet.cc - it doesn't compile yet, but you should get the idea of the intended use
