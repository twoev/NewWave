Noise Elimination With Wavelets At Vast Energies

Author: James Monk

Perform wavelet analysis of particle collision events for pile-up (noise) mitigation or event/object classification.  
The wavelet event can be instantiated on a large range of 4-vector-like objects, including entire HepMC events, Rivet particles, or 
ROOT TLorentzVectors.

This is copied from the old newwave page and svn repo on hepforge (newwave.hepforge.org), which isn't back up after the migration to phabricator.
